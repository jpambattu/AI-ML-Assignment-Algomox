Run the model_level_A.py file first,
It is the model developed for prediction.


Then run the app.py file for getting prediction results on the evaluation dataset.



Random Forest Classifier is used since it gave the best results on the given dataset.
Accuracy about 97.8% was obtained.

Confusion matrix on the results are produced and plotted using matplotlib and values are saved in the accuracy_results.txt file

This is a classification problem; whether suspicious or not. So inorder to understand the performance of this classification model Confusion matrix is selected.

A confusion matrix is a table that is used to define the performance of a classification algorithm. A confusion matrix visualizes and summarizes the performance of a classification algorithm.


Intent for User custom input is also given int the file. Only essential values are input. User can input through terminal.

The result (Prediction) is also print on the same; whether Suspicious or not.
